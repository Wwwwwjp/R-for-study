# Everyone makes mistakes. Do not feel frustrated with bugs.
# Debugging ususally takes most of your time.
# Syntax error is easy to be handled. Fixing logic error is much harder.


###########################Organization###########################
# Good organization and programming style avoid lots of mistakes.
# Always use a flow chart or block diagram as a blueprint of your project.
# Program your code step by step. Haste makes waste.
# Never write a too long line if you are not experienced.
# Use indentations or spaces to write code in small chunks.
# Comments are good to read and understand the code.

 
###########################Verification###########################
# Verfication/tracking at every step is really helpful.
# Guessing or staring at your code does not help much because you are not a computer.
# The more output in the Console/Plots panel/Environment, the better understanding about what happens behind the screen. 
# If a variable confuses you, print it out.
# When a function is defined, always check its input (parameters) and output (reture values) by stopifnot.
# when data sets are imported or exported, verify them immediately by checking the corresponding variables or files.
# Always be case- and type-sensitive.
# For a loop, you need to check the starting and ending case first, then just one more middle case.


#############################Isolation############################
# Troubleshooting needs to isolate bugs first.
# Usually, do not debug in a R markdown file because it is involved with too many things.
# Extracting and simplifying your code in a new .R file makes debugging much easier.
# Comment out your code instead of delete it because you might need it later for debugging.


# If all the tricks do not work, try to restart or upgrade R, RStudio or your computer. Sometimes, rebooting and updating can fix lots of trouble.
