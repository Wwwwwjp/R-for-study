# 1. Draw a tic-tac-toe board.
# 2. Add the playing loop and switch the players.
# 3. Add click-to-play.
# 4. Add check for a win.
# 5. Require play on empty square. (And change empty representation
#    from "E" to " " because it makes board easier to read.)
# 6. Add computer player without AI, just choosing a remaining empty square randomly
