# HW3
# If you are going to take STAT305: Advanced R, please keep all your files of HW3. 
# We will continue to discuss and improve them in STAT305.



# Part 1; Jackknife
# Understand the scheme of linear regression first
# Why does it fail to show the genuine outlier here?
# Fix the problem by Jackknife.
# A typical trial and error method: 
#   drop one data 
#   get the best fitting line for the remaining data
#   compare the differences between the dropped data and the corresponding best fitting lines 



# Part 2: Web-Scraping
# Just apply all the tricks your learned for regex and web-scraping here.



# summary
# 1. Trial and error in the webpage exploration always helps
# 2. Following the three steps (get a list, visit each webpage, extract data from each page) above is the key
# 3. Always verify your code by comparing its output with webpage's contents
# 4. Regex is super convenient
