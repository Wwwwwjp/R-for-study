# 1. Draw a tic-tac-toe board.
# 2. Add the playing loop and switch the players.
# 3. Add click-to-play.
# 4. Add check for a win.
# 5. Require play on empty square. (And change empty representation
#    from "E" to " " because it makes board easier to read.)
# 6. Add computer player without AI, just choosing an remaining empty square randomly
# 7. Expandability:
# 7-a. Generalize program to play n-by-n, not 3-by-3, tic-tac-toe.
# 7-b. Add computer player with a little AI or invinsible AI, ... challenging, coming soon ...
# 7-c. Minor improvement, ... check the comments below ...
# 7-d. Other chess game, ... coming soon ...
